# AlarmClock

This is a Python script for creating a simple GUI alarm clock using the Tkinter library. The script allows the user to set the time for the alarm and plays a sound when the alarm time is reached.

# Getting Started

To run the program, make sure you have Python 3 and the required dependencies installed. You can install the dependencies using pip:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Once you have the dependencies installed, run the program using:

`python alarm_clock.py`

# Usage

When you run the program, you'll see a window with three dropdown menus that allow you to set the time for the alarm. Once you've set the time, click the "Set the Alarm" button to start the alarm. When the alarm goes off, you'll hear a sound and the program will exit.
